ArgoCD App of Apps deployment

1. GitHub Repo which contains the Applications that I want to deploy :
https://github.com/vjkancherla/ArgoCD-Helm


2. In the GitHub Repo, all the Applications that I want to deploy, using helm chars from Artifact-Hub, are :
a. defined as ArgoCD-Application manifests
b. stored under https://github.com/vjkancherla/ArgoCD-Helm/Apps-From-ArtifactHub/templates
c. there is another Helm chart - https://github.com/vjkancherla/ArgoCD-Helm/Additinal-Configs - which contains the addition configs required for the Applications


3. Create a file called Apps.yaml.
This file is a ArgoCD-Application manifest which references https://github.com/vjkancherla/ArgoCD-Helm
We deploy this file to ArgoCD locally using Kubectl
ArgoCD will "crawl the links" and deploy all the Applications that are defined in
  - https://github.com/vjkancherla/ArgoCD-Helm/Apps-From-ArtifactHub/templates
  - https://github.com/vjkancherla/ArgoCD-Helm/Additinal-Configs

To summarise, we create a single Argo Application, which in turn references all the other Applications that I want to deploy.

My Macbook is not powerful enough to handle this deployment.
